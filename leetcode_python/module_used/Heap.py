heapq -- provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.
Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children

heapq.heappush(heap, item)Â¶ Push the value item onto the heap, maintaining the heap invariant
