### What is Binary Search?



Binary Search is one of the most fundamental and useful algorithms in Computer Science. It describes the process of searching for a specific value in an ordered collection.

> Terminology used in Binary Search:
>
> - Target - the value that you are searching for
> - Index - the current location that you are searching
> - Left, Right - the indicies from which we use to maintain our search Space
> - Mid - the index that we use to apply a condition to determine if we should search left or right

Other Binary Search Defintions:

------

Binary Search is generally composed of 3 main sections:

1. ***Pre-processing\*** - Sort if collection is unsorted.
2. ***Binary Search\*** - Using a loop or recursion to divide search space in half after each comparison.
3. ***Post-processing\*** - Determine viable candidates in the remaining space.
