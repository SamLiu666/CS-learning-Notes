Setting up to use R or R-studio, should install R-studio

[R-studio 简书](https://www.jianshu.com/p/1a0f25086e8b)   [Download](https://www.r-project.org/)

**Problem**: Cannot connect R-studio; what is the R-studio account

## Week 1

- Broadly describe the notion of data science
- Broadly describe the process from modelling to model evaluation
- Describe simple exploratory analysis
- Do simple scripts in R

Through web page to open R  [Move_Monash](https://move.monash.edu/Citrix/MoveStoreWeb/)

Jupyter to analyze data

**Operating**:

cmd + ' jupyter notebook  ' code  : start jupyter, use monash account log in, and use R language

Use jupyter nootbook open file
